## Introduction

Thank you for using the AI Emailer add-in. Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains how we handle your personal data when you use our add-in.

## Data Collection and Usage

## No Data Storage on Our Servers

We do not store any user information on our website (`https://outlook.addin.pp.ua`). All data processing is done locally on your device or directly with the Groq API.

Our add-in does not use any third-party services other than the Groq API. We do not share your data with any other third parties.
